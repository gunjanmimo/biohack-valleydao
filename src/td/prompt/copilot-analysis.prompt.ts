export const StepGenerationSystemPrompt = `
Based on the user provided research project details, list the minimum number of key literature-based research areas (max 6) that are essential for understanding or advancing the project. Do not include business, user research, or anything that requires lab work.

Only include areas that are central to the scientific feasibility and scalability of the technology. Fewer is better. Avoid loosely related topics.

List the steps in a logical order — each should build on the last.

Each step should include:
    A bolded title
    An italicized one-sentence explanation using "we" or "let’s"

export const QueryGenerationSystemPrompt = `
You will be given a list of 1-7 key research focus areas. Each one outlines a focus area for conducting literature reviews that will be completed using a novel AI agent capable of doing deep text-based research. Your task is to generate a series of standalone research queries that will help to reveal the answers to each of the key research focus areas. Questions should be answerable within a literature review and not require any physical investigation to answer. As such, they should be carefully worded to ensure there is no confusion and the queries are very specific and direct without too much filler or complexity. List no more than 3 queries per focus area, but only include those that are genuinely central to answering the key question. Avoid including loosely related or tangential areas. The less queries you provide overall, the better as this will require less research and compute overall. You should also make the queries sequential. In other words, the answer to the first question can be used to make the next questions more direct and specific. As such, you will need to list the questions in a specific order to ensure that the answers are collected and imported into the question that follows. We will run the literature reviews in sequence and so the information we collect at each step can directly inform the next questions.

To make this machine readable, please give your answers as a list of .json objects. Where necessary, each question generated should include a variable which is enclosed within square brackets like this '[ENZYME]' where the answer to that variable is currently unknown. In following questions which require the answer to that variable to be included in the text of the question you should enclose it within curly brackets like this '{ENZYME}'. 

Here is an example of the formatting of the questions we are expecting:

1. What is the most prevalent type of [POLYMER] found in microplastics pollution?

2. What are the top 3 biggest [CONSUMERS] of microalgae by overall mass consumed in the marine ecosystem and can you give me a breakdown of the [pH] and [TEMPERATURE] as factors in their stomach environment which may impact enzyme activity?

3. Which naturally occurring [ENZYMES] have demonstrated the highest efficacy in degrading {POLYMER} at or close to {pH} and {TEMPERATURE}, and what specific [REACTION RATES] or catalytic efficiencies have been reported?

4. Have {ENZYMES} been successfully expressed and functionally validated in microalgae or other photosynthetic organisms? And, if so, how does the expression of these enzymes in microalgal hosts impact the growth rate, viability, and metabolic stability of the engineered strains?

5. What are the principal [BYPRODUCTS] of {ENZYMES} in plastic degradation?

6. What are the known or [ECOLOGICAL RISKS] associated with byproduct {BYPRODUCTS}, and how can they be evaluated or mitigated to prevent harm to marine organisms and habitats?

7. Which [MICROALGE STRAINS] possess well-characterized genetic manipulation toolkits, facilitating efficient and stable transformation?

8. Out of these {MICROALGE STRAINS}, which exhibit proven robustness under open-pond cultivation (e.g., resilience to fluctuating temperatures, pathogens, and light intensities)?

9. In what ways might the {BYPRODUCTS} of enzymatic microplastic degradation confer positive health effects on marine ecosystems or coral reef systems?

10. Which international, national, or regional [REGULATIONS] govern the deliberate release of genetically modified microalgae into open water bodies, and what data or impact assessments are typically required to secure regulatory approval?

Before returning your results, cut the list of queries down to a maximum of 10 total queries. Ensure that there is at least one query for each key focus area included in the final list. The final list should be a list of 10 queries that represent only the most important questions to validate whether or not the technology is feasible and how one might go about specifically developing it.
